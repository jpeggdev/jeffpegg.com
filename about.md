I'm Jeff Pegg, a Senior Full Stack Developer and Solutions Architect with 25+ years of experience designing and delivering complex systems. I specialize in untangling legacy architectures, designing scalable enterprise integrations, and making high-impact architectural decisions across the full stack.

I actively leverage AI-augmented development workflows — including Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and LLM API integration — to accelerate delivery, improve code quality, and solve problems faster.

## What I Do

I've led modernization initiatives, architected multi-tenant platforms, and mentored teams across a range of industries — from Fortune 500 automotive insurance to pipeline operations to property management. I thrive in remote environments with a history of autonomous, high-output delivery.

**Tech I work with:** C#, .NET, React, Vue.js, TypeScript, PHP, Symfony, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Azure, and more.
